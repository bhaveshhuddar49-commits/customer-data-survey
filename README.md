# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Insights

## Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, covering data extraction, cleaning, analysis, querying, visualization, and reporting.
The goal is to transform raw data into **actionable insights** using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present findings through a structured report and presentation.

## Dataset

* Source: Public / Provided dataset (CSV format)
* Description: Contains structured business-related data used for exploratory analysis and reporting
* Size: Medium-scale dataset suitable for analytics and dashboarding
* Data Types: Numerical, categorical, and date/time fields

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
* **Power BI** (Data modeling & dashboard creation)
* **Gamma** (Presentation creation)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Git & GitHub**

## Project Workflow / Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Imported dataset into Python using Pandas
* Performed initial data inspection and validation

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed data distributions and trends
* Identified missing values, duplicates, and outliers
* Generated summary statistics and visualizations

### 3. Data Cleaning & Transformation

* Handled missing and inconsistent data
* Standardized column names and formats
* Created new calculated fields where required

### 4. SQL Analysis

* Loaded cleaned data into databases:

  * PostgreSQL
  * MySQL
  * SQL Server

  * Perform joins and subqueries
  * Answer key business questions

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

* Built interactive dashboard with:

  * KPIs and summary metrics
  * Trend and comparison charts
  * Filters and slicers for user interaction

### 6. Reporting & Presentation

* Created a structured analytical report
* Designed a professional presentation using **Gamma**
* Summarized insights, trends, and recommendations
